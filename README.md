# eGFR-Mayo-Quadratic
Here's a complete Python code for calculating the Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) using the Mayo Quadratic equation
This code takes user inputs for age, serum creatinine level, and gender (M for male, F for female). It then calls the calculate_egfr function to calculate the eGFR using the Mayo Quadratic equation. The function performs input validation, handles exceptions, and applies appropriate medical guidelines for eGFR calculations.

Finally, the code displays the calculated eGFR if it is not None. The eGFR is rounded to two decimal places and displayed in mL/min/1.73mÂ² units, which is the standard unit for eGFR measurements.

Please note that this code assumes the user will enter valid inputs and does not include extensive error handling beyond the basics provided.
